# Two-dimensional-steady-state-heat-conduction
The study aims to solve the two-dimensional steady heat conduction over the simple rectangular domain with Length (L) and height (H) using Finite Volume Method. The problem is solved using C++ language and it is executed by simpliy running the script. 


The boundary conditions of the domain are as follows:

The boundary conditions are given in APPLY_BC function, which can be modifiable.
